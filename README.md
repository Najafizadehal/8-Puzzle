# 8-Puzzle
8-Puzzle Problem Solver with Hill Climbing Algorithm
This Python script provides a solution to the 8-puzzle problem using the hill climbing algorithm with two different heuristics. It visualizes the process of finding the solution using Pygame for graphical representation.
Prerequisites
Before running the script, make sure you have the following installed:

    Python 3.x
    Pygame
    Numpy

Installation

Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/8-puzzle-solver.git

Install the required dependencies:

   pip install pygame numpy

Usage

Navigate to the project directory:

   cd 8-puzzle-solver

Run the Python script:

   python 8_puzzle_solver.py

Follow the on-screen instructions to select the initial state of the puzzle.
Watch the visualization of the hill climbing algorithm with two different heuristics finding the solution to the 8-puzzle problem.

Features

Custom or Random Initial State: Choose to input a custom initial state or generate a random initial state for the 8-puzzle problem.
Hill Climbing Algorithm: The script uses the hill climbing algorithm to find the solution to the 8-puzzle problem.
Visualization: Pygame is used to visualize the process of finding the solution, showing the steps taken to reach the final state.
